> Trump has already changed the Republican Party. Its most hawkish element—hawkish in the Iraq War sense—has gone underground, if it still exists. The same goes for publicly stated Republican skepticism about Social Security and Medicare. One must be hostile to China, and skeptical, to some degree, of free trade. Especially since the arrival of the pandemic, it’s hard to find a true libertarian in the Party—at least among those who have to run for office.

Writing for *The New Yorker*, Nicholas Lemann has an interesting and informative [article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/11/02/the-republican-identity-crisis-after-trump) about the possibilities of what the post-Trump Republican Party (assuming there is one) would look like. My hunch is that we will see a Restorationist win in the near future, and a Reversalist shift in the long term. It would be a terrible outcome for the country if phonies like Tom Cotton or Josh Hawley *ever* became the face of the Republican Party, or worse, if Don Jr. did, for that matter.
